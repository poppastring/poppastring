# Mark Downie

I am currently working for [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/) as a Product Manager, spending my days building diagnostics tooling for Visual Studio, .NET and Azure.

- 📝 I blog about the things I am working on here [https://www.poppastring.com/blog](https://www.poppastring.com/blog)
- 🤷🏿‍♂️ I’m on Mastodon if you care to hear me rambling in short form [[Mastadon](https://dotnet.social/@poppastring)](https://dotnet.social/@poppastring)
- 🙏🏿 Experimenting with [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/poppastring.com), we will see how long that lasts.
